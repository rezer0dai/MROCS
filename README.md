# MROCS
benchmark of MROCS algorithm inspired by MADDPG and my previous work ( wheeler ), benchmark for new framework rewheeler ( comming soon ) on multi agent environment Tennis from Unity

all informations are provided in .ipynb
- for actor i used NoisyNetworks for exploration
- i used batchnorm
- used own MROCS algorithm inspired by MADDPG
- well there are many improvements ~ see wheeler framework for example ( lot of different features and things to tune ), rewheeler soon
